# DancingLine
15-112 Term Project

This project is called DancingLine. I was inspired by one of my favorite games called dancingLine. 
This game uses 3D graphics to draw the moving line, path and wall. In the game, the line will move and the player may change the direction by giving different key press. The player should control the movement of the line so that the line can avoid hitting  the wall and collect as many rotating cubes(coins) as possible to boost up the total score.

In order to play the game, the player needs to run the file named "dancingline.py" in an editor. 
Place the python file and the soundEffect file together to accquire the sound effects in the game. There are two other screenshots in the same zip file, they are pictures for tutorial page. Make sure all the files listed above are in the same directory before running the game

To run this game, the only library you will need to install would be cmu_112_graphics. 

There are some shortcut that you may use to play this game. By pressing "Space" key, the game will pause and the resume until you hit "Space" one more time. When playing, you may comment the "checkGameOver" function in timerFired, so that the game will not end even if the line hit the wall.
